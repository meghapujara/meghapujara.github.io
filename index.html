              <p> Saint Jalaram was a devotee of Lord Ram. From very childhood, he served the Shadhu, saints and needy without any bias, opinion or discrimination of any kind. He had done hard labor to earn money to serve the society. With the name of Lord
                Ram on their lips, mind and heart, his wife and him served men, women, child, old, young, rich, poor and animals alike. His spirit continues to serve the people who believe in him and who need desperate help in every day trouble in life.</p>
              His temples are found all over the world. Many devotees of Jalaram are residing in the USA. They formed Jalaram Seva Samaj of North America (JSS) to continue the tradition Jalaram began to serve the public.

            With the Blessing of Saint Jalaram, the JSS is progressing rapidly. The JSS is well recognized by the devotees of Jalaram for the variety of activities. A character specific to the JSS is that its volunteers area holding many constructive activities with
            superior cooperation, excellent organization and unparalleled togetherness.

            One beautiful morning, while Jayendra Unadakat was praying Jalaram, a wonderful thought of celebrating Jalaram Jayanti (birthday) magnificently crosses his mind. This thought lead to many surprises. He spoke to his wife about this and she gracefully supported
            the thought. Both husband and wife shared their desire to their close family. They very well received the idea of celebrating Jalaram's birthday. They spoke to their friends Pankaj Patel, Prafulla Patel, Mahesh Patel, Girish Lad, Jay Mistry
            and Raju Gajjar regarding the inspiration. They worked with Jayendra Unadakat in planning and coordinating the first Jalaram Jayanti celebration. Shree Dinesh Jani also volunteered his services for religious related matters.

            The first program in New Jersey was planned for Sunday, November 5, 1995, at the Hindu Community Center, Kearny, New Jersey. The program was well received by the community. The program began with "RAM YAGNA", a religious process in which Lord Ram is prayed.
            (Jalaram prayed Lord RAM until his death.)

                <p>One hundred and eight couples hosted the RAM YAGNA. The cultural activities, gospel singing and grand dinner complemented the program. The devotees of Jalaram unanimously decided to celebrate this event every year and to build Jalaram
                  Dham (temple). This was the establishment of the Jalaram Seva Samaj of North America. The JSS began with the support of a few individuals and in few years, many other devoted families joined. The volunteers provide their valuable time
                  and other resources for activities held by the JSS.</p>

                <p>A person does not need pay any fee to join the organization and to attend the program held by the JSS. No one is discriminated against race, religion or gender. Anyone could join the JSS like sugar mix with the milk.</p>

                <p>During all programs such as Lord Rama's birthday, Krishna's Birthday, Guru Purnima (Guru Day) Jalaram Jayanti, SitaRam Vivah, activities are planned per the belief of Hindu religion. In last few years, the JSS has organized Vishnu Yagna,
                  Ram Yagna, Maharudra Yagna, Marutinandan Yagna, Gayatri Yagna, Durga Puja, Datta Yag, Satyanarayana Maha Puja, Vishvashanti Yagna, etc. Devotees actively participate in each of this Yagnas.</p>

                <p>In November 1999, The JSS celebrated 200th birthday of Jalaram. This eight-day event was celebrated on a grand scale with lectures on Bhagvat and cultural programs. Bhupendra Pandya, a learned scholar on Hinduism from India was the speaker
                  at the event for all eight days.</p>

                <p>The JSS also has held program such as Navaratri every year. The public continues to sponsor these programs. The devotees of Jalaram invite the organization to their homes to hold gospel singing and praying. Monitory help is being sent
                  by mail by many devotees from all over the country and they are anxious about the Jalaram Dham. JSS has acquired a four acre land in central New Jersey to build Jalaram Dham. The organizer of Virpur Jalaram Temple (original birthplace)
                  recently announced public that they no longer would accept donation of any kind. They are advising the public to use their donation for other good cause in helping the need. This probably is the first charity organization that stopped
                  taking donation. This would help in collecting the fund for the Jalaram Dham in USA.</p>

                <p>Jalaram Dham (temple) will be build to serve the community and to educate the public in supporting and maintaining their religious beliefs and cultural values. The project would cost $2.5. The public is offering the donations for this
                  good cause. The temple is expected to be built in next few years. You could view the picture of proposed Jalrama Dham on this website.</p>

              <div class="modal-body">
                <p>At the age of sixteen, in 1816, Jalaram married Virbai, the daughter of Pragjibhai Thakkar (Somaiya) of Atkot.However, he was inclined to completely withdraw from materialistic life and become an ascetic, Virbai proved to be an asset to
                  him in his works of feeding poor and needy.</p>

                <p>At the age of 18, soon after returning from pilgrimage to Hindu holy places, Jalaram Bapa became the disciple of Bhoja Bhagat of Fatehpur, who accepted him as his disciple. Jalaram was given the "Guru Mantra" (mantra) and japa mala in
                  the name of Rama by his Guru Bhojalram. With blessings of his guru, he started "Sadavrat", a feeding center, a place where all sadhus and saints as well as the needy could have food any time.</p>

                <p>One day, a sadhu who came to his house gave him a deity of Lord Rama, forecasting that Hanuman, the monkey-god and devotee of Rama, would follow soon. Jalaram Bapa installed Rama as his family deity and after a few days, a deity of Hanuman
                  appeared out of earth, on its own. The deity of Rama's consort Sita and his brother Lakshmana also appeared. Due to a miracle the container in the house of Jalaram, where grains were stored, became inexhaustible. Later other devotees
                  and village folk joined him in his works of human welfare.</p>

                <p>Gunatitanand Swami once stopped at Virpur on His way from Junagadh where Jalaram Bapa eagerly served Him. Gunatitanand Swami was very pleased with Jalaram Bapa and blessed that his name will be celebrated throughout India and the town
                  of Virpur will be a grand pilgrimage point.</p>

                <p>Soon his fame spread as an divine incarnation. Whoever came to Virpur, whether Hindu or Muslim irrespective of caste, creed and religion were fed by Jalaram. This tradition of feeding people continues to this day in Virpur.</p>

                <p>Once a tailor named Haraji, who was suffering from severe stomach-ache came to him to get himself cured. Jalaram Bapa prayed to God and Haraji was cured. He fell at Jalaram Bapa 's feet and addressed him as Bapa. Since then he was known
                  as Jalaram Bapa. Soon his fame spread and people came to him to get rid of diseases and problems. Jalaram Bapa would pray for them in the name of Rama and miracles happened. Both Hindus and Muslims became his disciples. In 1822, Jamal,
                  son of a rich Muslim merchant fell ill and doctors gave up all hope. At that point of time, Haraji, told Jamal of his experience (parcha). Jamal, prayed from his house, that if his son is cured of the disease, he would give 40 maunds
                  of grain to Jalaram Bapa for sadavrat. His son recovered and Jamal visited house of Jalaram Bapa with cart load of grains and called him Jalla so Allah!!.</p>

                <p>At one time, God in the guise of an old saint told Jalaram to send Virbai to serve him. Jalaram consulted her and with her consent sent her with the saint. But after walking some miles and reaching a nearby forest, the saint asked Virbai
                  to wait for him. She waited but saint did not return. Instead, she heard an Akashwani stating that it was only to test the hospitality of the couple. Before the saint disappeared, he left a Danda [staff] and Jholi[Cloth bag], with Virbai.
                  Virbai returned home to Jalaram, as instructed by the celestial voice with Danda & Jholi. This Danda and Jholi are still at Virpur and kept on display in a glass enclosure.</p>
